<br>Bike share demand kaggle problem: from feature selection, eda to ML models!

<h1>Overview</h1>
<br>Weâ€™re given with a bike sharing problem.
<br>Bike sharing platform is used to automate bike rentals from one station to another.
<br>Unlike the regular rental problems, our goal is not to identify the income generated but to use bike sharing data as mobility data within city to identify what are days and weather conditions bike riders prefer bike riding on and to predict number of bikers.
<br>Also if we can figure out interesting patterns, we might also identify important city events the bike riders are going for!
<br>This problem is a Regression Problem since we've to identify count of bike riders given various conditions!

<h1>About Dataset</h1>

Contains hourly and daily data csv for years 2011-2012 having fields like season, month, day of week, humidity, temperature and windspeed which help us predicting count of bike riders.
